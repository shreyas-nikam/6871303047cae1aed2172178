      <google-codelab-step label="1. Understanding Risk Governance through Simulation" duration="300">
          Welcome to the <strong>Risk Governance Lab</strong>! This application is designed to help you understand and simulate crucial aspects of risk management within a firm’s <strong>risk appetite</strong> framework. In today’s dynamic business environment, effective risk governance is paramount for organizational stability and success. It’s about setting boundaries, making informed decisions, and proactively managing potential threats.  This lab provides a hands-on experience by allowing you to:  <ul>
<li>strong</li>
<li>strong</li>
<li>strong</li>
<li>strong</li>
</ul>
   Key Concept: Risk Appetite is the amount and type of risk that an organization is willing to take in order to meet its strategic objectives. It sets the boundaries for risk-taking and guides decision-making.   By interacting with this simulation, you’ll gain insights into how risk governance principles translate into practical decision-making and how a firm monitors its adherence to established risk thresholds.

      <google-codelab-step label="2. Generating Risk Scenarios and Defining Your Risk Appetite" duration="480">
          On this first page, “Data Generation &amp; Risk Appetite,” you will set the foundation for your risk simulation.  <h3>Generating Synthetic Risk Data</h3>
  Simulating diverse risk events is crucial for testing and optimizing governance policies. Generating synthetic data across various categories creates a safe testbed to evaluate risk responses and appetite settings. This aligns with a core governance best practice: <strong>“understand your risk universe”</strong> before defining your tolerance for risk.  <ol start="1">
<li>strong</li>
<li>strong</li>
<li>Click the </li>
</ol>
  Once generated, you will see a table of synthetic risk scenarios, each with:  <ul>
<li>strong</li>
<li>strong</li>
<li>strong</li>
<li>strong</li>
<li>strong</li>
<li>strong</li>
</ul>
  The financial, reputational, and operational impacts are generated using uniform random distributions:  <ul>
<li>Financial impact per event $ \sim \mathrm{Uniform}(0, 100000) $</li>
<li>Reputational impact per event $ \sim \mathrm{Uniform}(0, 10) $</li>
<li>Operational impact per event $ \sim \mathrm{Uniform}(0, 100) $</li>
</ul>
   Tip: Experiment with different numbers of scenarios to see how it affects your overall risk landscape.   <h3>Defining Your Risk Appetite</h3>
  After generating scenarios, the next crucial step in risk governance is to define the firm’s <strong>risk appetite</strong>. These numerical thresholds ensure that management actions and decisions are anchored to the organization’s capacity and comfort level with risk, supporting transparency and accountability.  You can define three key thresholds:  <ol start="1">
<li>strong</li>
<li>strong</li>
<li>strong</li>
</ol>
  Adjust these values using the number input fields. As you change them, the “Current Risk Appetite Thresholds” display will update immediately, reflecting your firm’s current risk tolerance.   Important Note: The &#34;Max Acceptable Incidents per Period&#34; in this simulation is applied as a threshold for the *initial operational impact* of a single event, rather than a count of events over time. This demonstrates one way a firm might set a tolerance for individual high-impact operational events.

      <google-codelab-step label="3. Simulating Risk Management Actions" duration="600">
          Navigate to the “Scenario Simulation” page using the sidebar. This section allows you to apply different risk management strategies to individual scenarios and observe their direct impact on the risk profile and compliance.  <h3>Selecting a Scenario and Action</h3>
  <ol start="1">
<li>strong</li>
<li>strong</li>
<li>strong</li>
<li>strong</li>
<li>strong</li>
<li>strong</li>
</ol>
   <h3>Configuring Action Parameters</h3>
  Depending on the action chosen, specific parameters will appear:  <ul>
<li>p</li>
<li>strong</li>
<li>strong</li>
</ul>
   Formulae for Mitigate: *   Residual Likelihood = Initial Likelihood $ \times $ (1 - Mitigation Factor (Likelihood Reduction %)) *   Residual Impact = Initial Impact $ \times $ (1 - Mitigation Factor (Impact Reduction %))   <strong>Transfer</strong>:  <ul>
<li>strong</li>
<li>strong</li>
</ul>
   Formulae for Transfer: *   Covered Amount = Initial Financial Impact $ \times $ Insurance Coverage Ratio (%) *   Residual Financial Impact = max(0, Initial Financial Impact - Covered Amount) - Insurance Deductible   <strong>Accept / Eliminate</strong>: These actions have no additional parameters.   Formulae for Eliminate:  <ul>
<li>Residual Likelihood = 0</li>
<li>Residual Impact = 0 </li>
</ul>
   <h3>Running the Simulation</h3>
  After selecting your scenario, action, and any parameters, click the <strong>“Run Simulation”</strong> button.  The application will then calculate the <strong>residual impact</strong> (the impact remaining after the action) and check for <strong>compliance</strong> against your predefined risk appetite thresholds. The results for the chosen scenario will be displayed in a table, showing both initial and residual metrics, along with compliance status (True/False) for financial, operational, and reputational aspects.  <ul>
<li>strong</li>
<li>strong</li>
<li>strong</li>
</ul>

      <google-codelab-step label="4. Logging Simulation Outcomes for Audit and Governance" duration="300">
          Still on the “Scenario Simulation” page, below the simulation controls, you’ll find the <strong>“Simulation Log.”</strong>  Maintaining a historical log of simulated risk scenarios and their policy outcomes is vital for <strong>compliance, continuous governance improvement, and enabling trend/portfolio analysis.</strong> This aligns with good governance practices: tracking and reviewing risk-response effectiveness over time.  Each time you run a simulation for a scenario, its outcome is automatically added or updated in this log. If you simulate the same scenario multiple times with different actions or parameters, the log will show the most recent simulation outcome for that specific scenario.  The simulation log provides a comprehensive record of:  <ul>
<li>The scenario details.</li>
<li>The chosen risk management action.</li>
<li>The initial and residual likelihood and impact metrics.</li>
<li>The compliance status for financial, operational, and reputational risk appetite.</li>
</ul>
   Tip: Experiment by simulating different actions for the same scenario. Observe how the residual impacts and compliance status change, and how the log updates to reflect your most recent decision.   This log forms the basis for the analytical insights presented on the next page.

      <google-codelab-step label="5. Analyzing Cumulative Impact Over Time" duration="420">
          Navigate to the “Impact Analysis” page using the sidebar. This section provides powerful visualizations derived from your simulation log, helping you understand the overall picture of risk within your firm.  <h3>Calculating Cumulative Impact</h3>
  Aggregating risk impacts over time offers decision-makers critical insights into policy performance long-term. Tracking cumulative financial losses and compliant incident counts helps identify trends, reassess risk appetites, and adjust mitigation strategies proactively.  The application processes your <code>simulation_log</code> to calculate two key cumulative metrics:  <ol start="1">
<li>p</li>
<li>p</li>
</ol>
  The results are displayed as interactive line charts:  <ul>
<li>strong</li>
<li>strong</li>
</ul>
   Insight: These charts help you visualize the &#34;portfolio effect&#34; of your risk decisions. Are you consistently staying within acceptable financial limits? How effective are your actions at keeping operational risks compliant?   

      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="6. Aggregating Results to Identify High-Risk Areas" duration="360">
          Still on the “Impact Analysis” page, this section provides a high-level overview of the overall risk exposure and the effectiveness of different risk actions.  <h3>Grouping and Visualizing Aggregated Data</h3>
  Grouping simulation results by <strong>risk category</strong> and <strong>chosen action</strong> allows senior management to quickly pinpoint areas with the greatest financial impact, where certain actions are more or less effective, and where risk appetite is most frequently breached. This targeted insight enables efficient resource allocation and focused policy adjustments.  The application aggregates your <code>simulation_log</code> by <code>Risk Category</code> and <code>Chosen Action</code>, calculating the total <code>Residual Financial Impact</code> for each group. The aggregated data is displayed in a table and an interactive bar chart.  <ul>
<li>strong</li>
<li>Which risk category has the highest overall financial exposure after actions?</li>
<li>Among a specific risk category, which action (e.g., Mitigate vs. Transfer) resulted in a lower aggregate financial impact?</li>
<li>Are there certain risk categories where a particular action consistently leads to high residual impacts, suggesting it might be an ineffective strategy for that risk type?</li>
</ul>
    Actionable Insight: If you notice a particular risk category consistently showing high residual financial impact, or if a specific action seems ineffective across multiple scenarios, it&#39;s a strong indicator to revisit your risk appetite for that category or refine your strategy.   By utilizing these aggregation tools, you can move beyond individual scenario analysis to a more holistic view of your firm’s risk profile and the effectiveness of its governance framework.  This concludes your guide to the Risk Governance Lab. We encourage you to experiment with different inputs and observe how changes cascade through the simulation, providing a deeper understanding of risk management and governance principles.
