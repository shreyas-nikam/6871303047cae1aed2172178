This interactive application simulates risk management strategies and visualizes their impact within a firm's defined risk appetite.
It allows users to define risk appetite thresholds, simulate risk events, and apply various risk management actions.

The application is structured as follows:

-   **Step 1: Data Generation:** Generate synthetic risk scenario data.
-   **Step 2: Risk Appetite Definition:** Define the firm's risk appetite thresholds.
-   **Step 3: Scenario Outcome Simulation:** Simulate scenario outcomes based on risk management actions.
-   **Step 4: Logging Simulation Outcomes:** Log simulation outcomes for audit and governance.
-   **Step 5: Cumulative Impact Over Time:** Calculate cumulative impact over time.
-   **Step 6: Aggregating Results:** Aggregate results to identify high-risk areas.
